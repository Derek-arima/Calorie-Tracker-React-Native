# Calorie-Tracker-React-Native
# Overview

{This app is used to track your daily and weekly calorie intake. You can type in the amount of calories you consumed each meal of the day and the app will add that amount to your daily and weekly total. You can see the amount of calories you have consumed each day of the week. Just input your calorie intake per meal in the day of the week and the app will add it to your total!}

{I created this app because I was curious about how much calories I was consuming each day. I wanted to see if I was eating too much or too little. I work at a fast food restaurant and I eat one meal there every day that I work. The food may not be the healthiest so I was curious as to how much it was affecting my daily calorie intake.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

{I used React Native to create this app because I wanted to make something that was cross-platform. I used Visual Studio Code as my code editor. I used the Expo Go app to test my app on my phone.}

{I used javascript to create this app.}
